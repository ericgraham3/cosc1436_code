Embracing Simplicity: A Developer's Note on Executioner's Oath: Online

Greetings, brave adventurers of Executioner's Oath: Online!

As the lead developer of our beloved game, I come bearing news and insights into our game's future. First and foremost, I extend my heartfelt gratitude to each and every one of you for your unwavering support and dedication to EO:O. Your passion and enthusiasm have made this journey truly remarkable.

Today, I wish to address a topic that has been eagerly discussed amongst our playersâ€”the introduction of upper case letters. We understand that this feature has been eagerly anticipated, and many of you have expressed a desire to see it implemented.

Let me assure you that we, too, see the value of this enhancement. Capital letters could bring added depth and flavor to our storytelling and enrich the immersion within the world of Executioner's Oath: Online.

However, as with any software project, we must navigate the challenges of resource allocation and prioritize our efforts. Regrettably, I must acknowledge that our team currently faces limitations in terms of available development resources. As such, we must make cautious decisions about the features we implement and the timeline in which we introduce them.

While the introduction of upper case letters may seem like a straightforward task, it requires meticulous attention to detail and thorough testing to ensure seamless integration without disrupting the existing gameplay experience. We are committed to delivering nothing short of excellence, and this means dedicating sufficient time and effort to guarantee the feature's flawless implementation.

With that said, we want to emphasize that your feedback is invaluable to us. Your continued passion for the game fuels our determination to make Executioner's Oath the best it can be. We are carefully listening to your suggestions and eagerly planning for future updates.

Rest assured, our journey together has only just begun. We are exploring avenues to expand our development team and streamline processes to accelerate the pace of future enhancements. Your unwavering patience and support during this time of growth are truly appreciated.

Thank you for being an integral part of our community and sharing this epic adventure with us.

May you keep your head when all around you are losing theirs!

Sincerely,

Eric Graham

Vowel Packs will be obtainable through in-game quests, achievements, and rare drops from formidable foes. For those seeking a quicker path to mastering the power of vowels, they will also be accessible through the In-Game Store.

As developers, we are always dedicated to striking a balance between enriching gameplay and maintaining a fair gaming environment. The introduction of Vowel Packs is no exception, and we are eager to hear your feedback to further refine and expand this exciting feature.
